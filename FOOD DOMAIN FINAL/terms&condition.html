        <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>Any dispute or claim arising from or related to your use of our website or our products or services will be resolved through binding arbitration, rather than in court, unless you opt-out of arbitration by following the opt-out procedures described below.

            Arbitration is a process in which a neutral third party (the arbitrator) decides the outcome of a dispute after hearing arguments and evidence from both parties. Arbitration is generally faster and less expensive than litigation in court.
            
            You agree to submit any dispute or claim to arbitration before a single arbitrator, who will be selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration will take place in the United States and will be conducted in English. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
            
            If you wish to opt-out of arbitration, you must do so within 30 days of the date you first used our website or our products or services by sending a written notice to us at the following address: [insert address]. Your opt-out notice must include your name, address, phone number, and email address, as well as a statement that you wish to opt-out of arbitration.
            
            If you opt-out of arbitration, any dispute or claim will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in [insert location], and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for any such disputes or claims.
